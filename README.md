# Spotify wrapper

## Disclaimer

This is my Spotify wrapper library based on @willianjusten's Test Driven Development course.

I bought it on Udemy in june 2018 but never really finished it. When I tried to start the course again now, quarentined in 2020, I realized it was sadly and understandably very outdated: some packages stopped working and the Spotify Web API made some breaking changes.

But I didn't want to give up on the main practical project since I felt it could teach me a lot about testing with Javascript. That said, the main goal of this project is to try and reproduce it's instructions in a slightly different development environment, with more up-to-date packages. And Typescript, because who doesn't love Typescript? :) I'm also trying Jest this time since I'm already familiarized with Karma/Jasmine and Mocha/Chai.
